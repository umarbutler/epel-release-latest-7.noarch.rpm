# epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
This is a repository that preserves `epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`, downloadable [here](https://github.com/umarbutler/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm/raw/main/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm). The file was previously available on the Fedora Project's website, however, it can no longer be found there. The copy preserved in this repository was taken directly from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240714053104/https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm). This file is used for, amongst other things, [installing Tesseract on Amazon Linux 2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74061696) (and, by extension, Amazon SageMaker notebooks).
